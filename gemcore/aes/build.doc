Building the AES with Pacific C
===============================

  The project PPDAES.PRJ is used to generate the AES. To compile it, you
will need LDIV.OBJ and LMUL.OBJ; these files are part of the C runtime
library. To extract them, edit GETLDIV.BAT so that LIBDIR is set to
the name of your Pacific C library directory (eg: C:\PACIFIC\LIB). Then
run GETLDIV.BAT to extract the object files.
