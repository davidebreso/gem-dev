Notes on Pacific C and RSCREATE:

  RSCREATE appears to work in the small model, but the .RSC file it produces 
has a different layout from the original EXAMPLE.RSC (supplied). It does
not work in the large model.

  The warning level has been set to 5, so that the machine-generated 
EXAMPLE.RSH file can be compiled without warnings.
