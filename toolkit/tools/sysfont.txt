SYSFONT v1.02                                   John Elliott, 14 December 2002
==============================================================================

  SYSFONT is a program which can edit the GEM system font (as stored in a
GEM driver). It can also be used as a DOS font editor.
  SYSFONT has been tested under GEM/2 and later; it looks its best under
FreeGEM. 

Release History
===============

1.02: Added support for Windows .FON files (not full support, but enough
     to import/export the FixedSys font (VGAFIX.FON)). Automated transcoding
     function to convert DOS or Windows fonts to GEM. Some usability bug fixes 
     and better error reporting.
1.01: Added keyboard shortcuts for Copy/Cut/Paste. Included a copy of 
     SDPSC9.VGA with a more ViewMAXy font.
1.00: Initial release.

Installation
============

1. Copy SYSFONT.APP and SYSFONT.RSC to a directory in your search path -
  in GEM/3, I recommend \GEMAPPS.

2. Under GEM: Highlight SYSFONT.APP, select "Configure application" from the
  "options" menu, and set up as follows:
              Document types:    PSF ROM VGA FON
              Application type:  GEM
              Needs full memory: No
              Memory required:   256k
              Icon type:         Whatever you want.

  Note that if you have the EDICON icon editor, you can use it to import the
two supplied icon files into DESKHI.ICN.

  Then select "Save desktop" from the "options" menu.

3. Under ViewMAX: Highlight SYSFONT.APP, select "Configure application" from
  the "options" menu, and set up as follows:

              Takes parameters:   [ ]
              Document types:     PSF ROM VGA FON
              Icon type:          Whatever

  Then select "Save preferences" from the "options" menu.
  Note that to use SYSFONT from ViewMAX, you will need a working GEM
 installation as well.


Use
===

  Start SYSFONT by clicking its icon, or by double-clicking a font/driver 
file. If you double-click a file, it will be opened within SYSFONT;
otherwise SYSFONT will start with no files open.
  SYSFONT supports files in these formats:
* GEM driver
* PSF (Linux console font) - note that the PSF2 format is not supported.
* DOS console font
* Spectrum +3 font
* TOS 1.00 ROM image
* Windows .FON font (only tested with the Windows 3.x VGA fonts VGAFIX.FON and 
 VGAOEM.FON, and the Windows 1.x fonts HIFONTS.FON and LOFONTS.FON).

  When you open a file, it appears in a split-pane format. The left-hand pane
contains an enlarged view of the current character, while the right-hand pane
shows the characters in the font. Use the scrollbar at the bottom of the
window to move through the characters. The currently selected character is
highlighted; you can select a different character by clicking on it.

  Some types of file have two or three fonts in them. In this case, the arrows
on the vertical scrollbar can be used to select the current font; or click on
a character in the requested font.

  It is possible to have multiple characters selected for an operation. To
do this, move the text cursor over the first one, click, and drag to the last
one. The window will scroll automatically if you go off the left or right end.

The File menu
=============
  This menu has five options:

New...       Create a new font file from scratch.
Open...      Open a file. You can have multiple fonts loaded at once.
Save         Save the current file.
Save As...   Save the current file under a new name, and maybe in a new format
             as well.
Quit         Quit the program.

The Edit menu
=============

Edit | Cut and Edit | Copy
--------------------------
  The Cut and Copy options will copy the selected character (or range of
characters) to the clipboard. In the case of Cut, the selected characters
are then blanked.

Edit | Paste
------------

  The contents of the clipboard are copied into the currently selected font.
If a single character is selected, then that character and as many subsequent
characters as necessary will be replaced with the characters on the clipboard.
If multiple characters are selected, then only the selected characters will
be replaced.

  For example: Highlight the range A-H, and then do Edit | Copy.
  Click on Z, and do Edit | Paste. 8 characters are pasted.
  Highlight the range Q-T, and do Edit | Paste. 4 characters are pasted.

Edit | Select all
-----------------
  Selects the current font. Note that if a file contains more than one font,
only the currently active font will be selected.

Edit | Preferences
------------------
  The Preferences command allows you to choose the colours used in the font
window and for highlighting selections.
  Colour settings are stored in the file SYSFONT.CFG; delete this file to
restore the default settings.

The Font menu
=============
  The Font menu only has one option: Transcode. This will shuffle the 
characters in a font, converting between GEM, DOS, and ISO-8859-1 codepages.
This is a lossy operation; characters in the destination codepage which 
aren't in the source codepage will be set to blank.

The Transform and Effects menus
===============================
  These menus can only be used when a font is being edited. They both
describe various transformations that can be done to the selected character
or range of characters. Be careful - you can't undo them!

The Window menu
===============

  This has two ways of arranging all the SYSFONT windows on the screen. It
does not affect desk accessory windows.

Example of use
==============
  To replace the 8x16 font in the GEM/3 driver with the ViewMAX one:

* Load UDUNI9.VGA and SDPSC9.VGA into SYSFONT.
* On the UDUNI9.VGA window, click on a character in the bottom font.
* Highlight the characters SPACE to ¨.
* Use Edit | Copy.
* On the SDPSC9.VGA window, click on the SPACE character in the bottom font.
* Use Edit | Paste.
* Save SDPSC9.VGA, and leave the program.

  Note that I only copied SPACE to ¨ (characters 32 - 168). Outside
this range, the characters don't correspond (though you could copy more 
over, one at a time, or transcode the font from DOS to GEM and copy the 
characters in larger groups).

  The example file SDPSC9.VGA has had this done; you can use it as-is in 
GEM/3, or transfer the font into another driver such as SDPSC11.BS for GEM/5.
