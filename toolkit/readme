GEM Developers' Kit - Open Watcom libraries     Davide Bresolin, December 2021
==============================================================================

Version 1.0.1

This is based on John Elliott's GDK for Pacific C version 1.0.3 downloadable
from <http://www.seasip.info/Gem/devkit.html>. 

Building the libraries
======================

You need GNU Make and Open Watcom V2 C compiler, assembler and linker. Edit
makedefs.i to set the location of your Open Watcom installation, and type

        make clean
        make
        
to build the library and the examples.

Overview of use
===============

To use GEM functions, you need only
  
#include "wccgem.h"

to include all necessary files.

When linking your GEM applications, remember to add 
  
    $(LIB)/wccgem-s.lib (small model)
or  $(LIB)/wccgem-l.lib (large model)

to WLINK "library" directive. 

The directory samples/ contains a reference startup code stub (accstart.asm) to
create Desktop Accessories. By using the stub, a DA can be compiled as a normal
GEM application, and then linked with the

    libfile start-s.obj (small model)
or  libfile start-l.obj (large model)

WLINK directive to replace Open Watcom's startup code. See the examples in
samples/ for details on how to write and compile DA.
