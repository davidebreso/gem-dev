GEM Developers' Kit - Open Watcom libraries     Davide Bresolin, December 2021
==============================================================================

Version 1.0.2

This is based on John Elliott's GDK for Pacific C version 1.0.3 downloadable
from <http://www.seasip.info/Gem/devkit.html>. 

Building the libraries
======================

You need GNU Make and Open Watcom V2 C compiler, assembler and linker. Edit
makedefs.i to set the location of your Open Watcom installation, and type

        make clean
        make
        
to build the library and the examples.

Overview of use
===============

To use GEM functions, you need only

#include "wccgem.h"

to include all necessary files.

When linking your GEM applications, remember to add 
  
    wccgem-s.lib (small model)
or  wccgem-l.lib (large model)

to WLINK "library" directive. 

Examples
========

The directory samples/ contains Open Watcom ports of the GEM PTK sample
applications. 

The directory includes a custom startup code stub (accstart.asm) to create
Desktop Accessories. By using the stub, a DA can be compiled as a normal
GEM application, and then linked with the

    libfile start-s.obj (small model)
or  libfile start-l.obj (large model)

WLINK directive to replace Open Watcom's startup code. See the examples in
samples/ for details on how to write and compile Desktop Accessories.

Documentation
=============

The majority of the code written by John Elliott for Pacific C worked correctly
out of the box. However, I had to use a few tricks to port some of the more 
advanced functionalities: USERDEF objects, hooking the AES or VDI and create
Desktop Accessories. I logged this journey in doc/wccgem.doc.

The directory doc/ includes also the original documentation from the Pacific C
Developer's kit and the original GEM PTK.
