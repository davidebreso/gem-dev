Development tools for GEM                                Davide Bresolin, 2021
==============================================================================

This repository contains the source code of various parts of FreeGEM that I
ported to Open Watcom, plus some patches, bugfixes and improvements.

This is based on John Elliott's GDK and GEM Desktop 3.2.4 for Pacific C
downloadable from <http://www.seasip.info/Gem/gengem.html>.

Thanks and Greetings to John Elliott and all the people of the FreeGEM team,
that did the heavy lifting of porting and updating Digital Research GEM source
code to more modern compilers.

Have fun, 
Davide
